    content: `Twenty-some years ago, Zakk Wylde found himself at a crucial juncture. The guitarist could hit the road with Ozzy Osbourne, the man who gave his career its launching pad. He could kick around with what was left of a post-Slash Guns N' Roses. Or he could take a chance on himself.
    With Ozzy needing a quick answer and GNR showing no real signs of life, Wylde took the third option. He enlisted a friend, drummer Phil Ondich, and headed to Miami with a head full of riffs and what was likely a massive alcohol budget. The result was Sonic Brew, with an approach more akin to his bludgeoning, pinch harmonic-happy work with Osbourne than his earlier Southern rock-influenced solo album, Book of Shadows. Sonic Brew marked the formation of a new band, Black Label Society, the music and aesthetic of which has kept Wylde going in between his subsequent turns with Osbourne. 
    To mark the record's two decades, Wylde and the current BLS lineup polished up the original recordings and revisited some of the songs from a different angle for a new edition of the LP, due out on May 17. An upcoming U.S. tour will celebrate the anniversary, with one night dedicated to the debut album and the next as more of a career-spanning set. The ever-busy Wylde currently finds himself in the midst of the Experience Hendrix tour, after which he'll hit the road with BLS and then return to Ozzy's ranks in the summer.  
    While en route to the Raleigh stop of Experience Hendrix, Wylde spoke with AllMusic about revisiting the Sonic Brew tunes, the cold turkey approach he took to reaching his sobriety (now in its tenth year), and the sense of humor that might seem at odds with his biker-bar presentation.`

    content: `Before he passed away in late 2017, blues guitarist Leo "Bud" Welch cut one final session in Nashville under the watchful eye of Dan Auerbach. Welch's story was a unique one; a lifelong musician and performer, he didn't make a record until his 80s. Released in 2014, Sabougla Voices took listeners back to the Mississippi Delta, blending blues and gospel with a raw urgency that was less traditional than it was sincere and striking. I Don't Prefer No Blues quickly followed, a more secular, raucous set that evoked the spirit of the juke joints of yore.
    Auerbach didn't compile his session with Welch into a record immediately, and in the intervening years, Welch passed away, as did Richard Swift, a prolific musician who had played drums on the record and had been part of the Black Keys' touring lineup. With a heavy heart but also with fond memories of the recording, Auerbach put the finishing touches on The Angels in Heaven Done Signed My Name, 10 tracks of first-take, no nonsense blues delivered by Welch as quickly as the band could handle. 
    In addition to sharing an exclusive first listen to The Angels in Heaven Done Signed My Name (due out March 8), we spoke with Auerbach about his time with Welch, the feedback loop of energy that was created in the room, and his chance to step into the shoes of Alan Lomax.`

    content: `This past month, a couple of recordings stood out to our reviewers. One was a contemporary re-creation of a Baroque pastiche opera by Hervé Niquet and Le Concert Spirituel, who used arias from 25 different French operas by 16 composers to create a new one, with a plot oddly similar to that of the 1960s American TV show Bewitched. Another was a riveting live recording of pianist Yuja Wang in Berlin. One more highlight was Thomas Zehetmair conducting a streamlined reading of the 1877 version of Bruckner's Symphony No. 3. `

    content: `Eleven years ago, Yola Quartey took the stage with Massive Attack at the Glastonbury Festival, just outside her and the band's hometown of Bristol. She sang classic songs like "Safe From Harm" and "Unfinished Sympathy" to the 60,000-strong crowd, which made for an unforgettable experience, but she was unsatisfied musically.
    She struck out on her own and focused on three of her main influences -- Otis Redding, Dolly Parton, and Aretha Franklin -- and caught the attention of Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, who teamed up with Yola to produce and co-write her debut album, Walk Through Fire.
    AllMusic spoke with Yola about the paths she didn't take, avoiding the retro route, and how her preternatural musical tastes as a teenager led her to seek out older friends.`

    content: `Among January's unexpected -- and enjoyable -- classical finds were things like reconstructions of ancient Greek music, two of the symphonies of 20th century American composer Florence B. Price, and some rarely-heard orchestral works of Saint-Saëns. We also caught up with the last of the releases commemorating the 100th anniversary of Debussy's death, just as we began receiving the ones commemorating the 150th anniversary of the passing of Hector Berlioz. `
