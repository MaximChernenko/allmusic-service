    bio: `Hollywood Undead hail from the streets of Hollywood, California, mixing brash hip-hop, rock,
    and minor metalcore touches with cocky posturing. With their colorful pseudonyms and unique hockey
    goaltender-inspired masks, the band debuted in 2008 with Swan Songs, but didn't hit their commercial
    stride until the release of their 2011 sophomore effort, American Tragedy, which cracked the Top Ten 
    on the Billboard 200 chart. Subsequent outings like Notes from the Underground (2013) and Day of the 
    Dead (2015) performed just as well, if not better, cementing the group's reputation as one of rapcore's 
    leading lights. Owing much of their popularity and exposure to the social networking website MySpace, 
    the group started as the musical project of J-Dog and Tha Producer in June 2005. They uploaded some new 
    music to their profile and very quickly started amassing song plays and online friends with tracks about 
    drinking, sex, and emo kids. "The gang," as the guys liked to refer to themselves, also grew to include 
    six members: J-Dog and Tha Producer alongside Charlie Scene, Johnny 3 Tears (formerly called the Server), 
    Funny Man, and Da Kurlzz. As the band's online profile steadily increased, MySpace head honcho Tom Anderson 
    wasn't immune and wound up featuring Hollywood Undead's song "No. 5" on MySpace's first compilation album, in 
    addition to giving them the distinction of being the first act signed to the site's new record label 
    (distributed by Interscope) in 2005. Swan Songs finally appeared in 2008 on A&M/Octone Records. A year later, 
    that label released an album of B-sides, live tracks, and covers titled Desperate Measures. In 2010, vocalist 
    Aron "Deuce" Erlichman left the group; he was replaced by Daniel "Danny" Murillo, a former contestant on 
    American Idol and lead singer of Lorene Drive. After shows with Avenged Sevenfold on The Nightmare After 
    Christmas Tour, Hollywood Undead released their sophomore album, American Tragedy, in April of 2011, and the 
    album debuted in the Top Five of Billboard's Top 200. The following November, A&M/Octone Records released a 
    remix version of the record called American Tragedy Redux, which featured mixes by Andrew W.K., Borgore, and 
    KMFDM, among others. In January of 2013, after embarking on The Underground Tour, Hollywood Undead released 
    their third studio album, Notes from the Underground, which proved to be their highest-charting outing to date, 
    landing at the number two spot on the Billboard Top 200 and soaring to number one on the Canadian albums chart. 
    Their hotly anticipated fourth studio album, Day of the Dead, arrived in March 2015, and was preceded by the 
    singles "Usual Suspects," "Gravity," "How We Roll," and the explosive title cut. The band returned to the 
    studio in late 2016 to record its fifth studio album, Five. With their contract with Interscope finished, 
    Hollywood Undead set up their own label, Dove & Grenade Media, in collaboration with BMG to release the 
    album. The first single, "California Dreaming" -- a scathing look at the inequalities between the two 
    sides of Los Angeles culture -- was released in mid-2017, with the full-length Five arriving later 
    that October. In 2018 the band released the standalone single "Gotta Let Go," a summery blast of 
    feel-good nostalgia about letting go of pain.`
